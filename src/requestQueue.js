// Code has been modified to solve 2 problems specific to this use case:

// 1) A limited number of commands can be executed simultaneously
// A visca camera has 2 command buffers where commands are stored when they
// are being executed. Should more than 2 commands be requested to be
// executed at once, only the first 2 will be kept and the rest discarded
// with an error message being returned.
// Therefore we use a queue with 2 heads (set with concurrency: 2
// in queueOptions).
// In essence, this isn't a problem with the queue, but a justification of why
// the queue is necessary in the first place

// 2) When commands are queued, the camera is not as responsive as it tries
//    to 'catch up' with the commands sent
// In the interest of responsiveness from the camera, only last generated
// command in each category (ie. move, zoom etc.) should be kept in the
// queue.
// As an example, if a camera is told to zoom at speed 1, then 2,
// then 3 in a short enough space of time that only the first command can be
// executed, the second command no longer matters, and so the next command
// to be sent to the camera should be to zoom at speed 3.
